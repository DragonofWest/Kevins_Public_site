        <h1>What are HTML Entities</h1>
            <p>From what I have gathered, <strong>Entities</strong> are pieces of code that are there to help you write things things to the page that can be mistaken for code by the browser.
                For instance we use &#34;Quatations&#34; in our code all the time. Entities are a code to insert these &#34;items&#34; into the page without getting them mixed up with the code.
                There are generally two ways of putting them in the site. By calling their &#35; or by their name. All entities have a &#35, but not all of them have a call name.
            </p>
            <p >You may be wondering how to insert these <strong>Entities</strong> into your work. Well they each come with a call number. To start this call number we begin
                with &amp; symbol, followed by either the name or the &#35; and number. Then we end with a &#59;. These will pop up in your text as the symbol you are looking for. 
                Listed below are a few websites that I found with lists of these entities.
