        <h1>What are HTML Entities</h1>
            <p indent=10px>From what I have gathered, <strong>Enitities</strong> are pieces of code that are there to help you write things things to the page that can be mistaken for code by the browser.
                For instance we use &#34;Quatations&#34; in our code all the time. Enitities are a code to insert these &#34;items&#34; into the page with out getting them mixed up with the code.
                There are generally two ways of putting them in the site. By calling their &#35; or by their name. All entities have a &#35, but not all of them have a call name.
            </p>
            <p indnent>You may be wondering how to insert these <strong>Enitities</strong>
